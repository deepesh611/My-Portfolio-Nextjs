summary: "A learning-focused infrastructure project demonstrating automatic server failover using Docker and Keepalived. Explores high-availability concepts through an active–passive setup rather than full-scale load balancing."

## Overview

This project demonstrates a **basic high-availability web service** using Docker and Keepalived across two self-managed machines. A static HTML website runs inside Docker containers, and a **virtual IP (VIP)** automatically switches between a primary and a backup node during failures.

The objective of this project was to **understand infrastructure-level failover mechanisms**, not to build a production-ready load balancing system.

---

## Why This Project

Single points of failure are a common cause of downtime in infrastructure setups. This project was implemented to explore how availability can be improved using simple, open-source tools without relying on managed cloud services or orchestration platforms.

It focuses on:
- Network-level failover using a floating virtual IP
- Container behavior during node failures
- Designing predictable active–passive infrastructure

---

## What This Project Does

- Runs identical Dockerized web services on two separate machines
- Uses Keepalived to manage a floating virtual IP
- Automatically transfers traffic to a backup node when the primary becomes unavailable
- Uses Portainer for optional container visibility and management
- Serves static HTML content to avoid state synchronization complexity

This setup follows a **well-known active–passive failover pattern**.

---

## Key Features

- Automatic VIP failover using Keepalived
- Docker-based service deployment
- Stateless static content hosting
- Optional container monitoring via Portainer
- Container restart policies for basic resilience

---

## Design Decisions

- **Keepalived** enables fast failover without DNS propagation delays
- **Docker** ensures consistent runtime environments across nodes
- **Stateless content** simplifies recovery and failover behavior
- **Active–passive architecture** keeps the system simple and predictable

---

## Limitations

- This is not a true load balancer; traffic is not distributed across nodes
- No HTTPS or TLS termination is configured
- Health checks are node-based, not application-aware
- Designed for learning and experimentation, not production traffic
