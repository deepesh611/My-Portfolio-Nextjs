> **Note:** This project was developed as part of a freelance engagement. Client details have been anonymized, and only non-sensitive functionality is shown.

## Overview

This project is a **workflow-driven Member Management System** designed to replace manual and spreadsheet-based record keeping with a structured, queryable platform.

The system uses a **React + TypeScript frontend** paired with **n8n workflows acting as the backend layer**, handling CRUD operations, validation, and automation. All data is stored in a **MySQL database**, and the application is designed to be deployed in a self-hosted environment.

A public demo is provided to showcase functionality and UI behavior.

## Problem This Project Solves

Organizations that rely on spreadsheets or fragmented tools often struggle with:
- Maintaining consistent member records
- Representing family and relational data
- Generating demographic insights
- Ensuring control over their data infrastructure

This project addresses those issues by providing a centralized system with structured data models, automation-driven backend logic, and built-in analytics.

---

## Core Capabilities

- **CRUD-based Member Management:** Structured creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of member records
- **Relational Data Modeling:** Family relationships (spouse, parent, child) represented through normalized tables
- **Employment Tracking:** Storage of professional and employment-related attributes
- **Analytics & Insights:** Demographic and employment summaries rendered through dashboards
- **Image Handling:** Support for profile images via uploads or external links
- **Bulk Operations:** CSV/XLSX-based data import for migration from existing records

---

## Tech Stack

This project follows a **low-code backend / pro-code frontend** approach:

- **Frontend:** React + Vite + TypeScript
- **UI & Styling:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Backend Logic:** n8n workflows exposed via webhooks
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Visualization:** Recharts

---

## Architecture

The system is designed around a **workflow-centric backend**:

1. **React Frontend**  
   Sends requests directly to n8n webhook endpoints.

2. **n8n Workflows**  
   Act as the API layer, handling validation, business logic, and SQL execution.

3. **MySQL Database**  
   Stores normalized relational data and supports complex queries.

This approach avoids maintaining a large custom backend codebase while keeping logic explicit and modular.

---

## Database Design

The schema is normalized to support real-world relationships:

- **Members:** Core identity and status information
- **Phones:** One-to-many contact records (primary, WhatsApp, emergency)
- **Employment:** Professional and employment details
- **Relationships:** Self-referential links defining family connections

---

## Trade-offs & Limitations

- Designed for internal or small-scale organizational use
- No authentication or role-based access control
- Workflow-based backend prioritizes flexibility over raw performance
- Demo deployment is for showcase purposes only

---

## Outcome & Learnings

- Delivered a complete CRUD-based system for a real client
- Gained experience using workflow automation as backend infrastructure
- Designed and implemented relational schemas for non-trivial data
- Balanced rapid development with maintainable system design
