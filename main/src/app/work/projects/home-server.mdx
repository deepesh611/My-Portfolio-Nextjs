## Overview

This project is a **comprehensive home server setup guide** that walks readers through turning a spare device — such as an old laptop, Raspberry Pi, or desktop — into a self-hosted server capable of running services like media servers, dashboards, and containerized applications.

The guide is written in a practical, beginner-friendly style and emphasizes clear, step-by-step documentation rather than abstract theory. The focus is on using modern, approachable tools to make self-hosting more accessible.

## Why This Guide

Setting up a home server can feel intimidating for many people due to scattered resources and complex tutorials online. This guide exists to:

- Break down the setup process into clear, incremental sections  
- Teach secure remote access without exposing open ports  
- Demonstrate how to use Docker and Portainer for service management  
- Provide examples for building a unified landing page and SSL-secured routing  

It is aimed at people who want to learn hands-on home-server setup without unnecessary jargon.

---

## What the Guide Covers

The guide leads users through the following stages:

- Preparing the hardware and flashing a Linux-based OS  
- Assigning a static IP and enabling SSH for remote management  
- Setting up secure remote access using Twingate  
- Installing Docker for managing applications as containers  
- Using Portainer's web UI to manage containers  
- Building a custom landing page for self-hosted services  
- Configuring Nginx Proxy Manager for SSL and domain routing  
- Deploying services such as media servers, file browsers, or dashboards  

Each section is designed to be accessible and practical, with links and instructions to help readers follow along at their own pace.

## Key Tools and Technologies

This guide demonstrates the use of:

- **Docker** for containerizing applications  
- **Portainer** for visual container management  
- **Twingate** for secure remote access without opening router ports  
- **Nginx Proxy Manager** for SSL certificates and domain routing  
- **Linux-based OS** setup for initial server configuration  
- Shell scripts and automation examples  
- Example dashboards built with Astro.js / Next.js  

These tools were selected for their usability and broad adoption in self-hosted environments, making the guide suitable for beginners and intermediate users alike.

## Approach and Design Decisions

- Focused on step-by-step documentation rather than software development  
- Emphasized tools that are user-friendly and reduce reliance on terminal commands where possible  
- Included secure remote access patterns to avoid common security pitfalls  
- Organized content to build confidence progressively  

The guide is a learning resource as well as a reference manual for people setting up their first home server.

---

## Limitations

- This is **not a packaged application or dashboard product**  
- It does **not include a complete automated installer**  
- The guide assumes some familiarity with concepts like networking and Linux basics  

Readers looking for hands-off "one-click" home server platforms might want to explore dedicated OS projects (e.g., CasaOS, Umbrel).

---

## Outcome & Value

- Offers a clear, structured approach to home server setup  
- Helps users gain confidence with remote access, Docker, and service management  
- Serves as a learning resource for self-hosting fundamentals  
- Provides practical steps for secure and meaningful home infrastructure
