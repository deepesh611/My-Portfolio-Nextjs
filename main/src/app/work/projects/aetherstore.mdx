title: "AetherStore"
publishedAt: "2026-01-02"
summary: "A lightweight, scalable, S3-style distributed object storage system written in Go. Unlike Hadoop/HDFS, AetherStore treats files as immutable objects and uses only Go's standard library plus SQLite for metadata. Currently supports standalone DataNode and Master Node services with Docker Compose orchestration."

## Overview

AetherStore is a distributed object storage platform designed for immutable, durable object storage across multiple nodes. The system separates concerns between storage workers (DataNodes) and metadata management (Master Node), using SQLite for metadata persistence and local filesystem storage for objects. It provides REST APIs for object lifecycle management, supports replication through random node placement, and is fully Dockerized for deployment.

## Key Features

- Durable writes with fsync guarantees on DataNode
- Immutable object storage with UUIDv4 identifiers
- REST API for PUT/GET/health operations on DataNode
- SQLite database with WAL mode for metadata
- Node registration and tracking via Master Node
- Random placement algorithm for replica distribution
- Docker Compose orchestration for multi-node deployment
- Persistent volume support for data durability

## Design Decisions

- Separated storage and metadata concerns between DataNode and Master Node for scalability
- Used SQLite with WAL mode instead of external databases to minimize dependencies and complexity
- Implemented immutable object storage to simplify consistency and enable safe concurrent access
- Chose random placement over consistent hashing for simpler implementation and adequate distribution
- Built with Go standard library only (plus SQLite driver) to reduce operational overhead
- Designed crash-safe durability through fsync and atomic file operations
- Used Docker Compose for orchestration to enable local development and testing of multi-node scenarios
