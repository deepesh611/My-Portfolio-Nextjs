## Overview

The **Multi-Agent Fraud Detection System** is a hybrid AI-driven platform designed to detect, investigate, and explain fraudulent insurance claims.  
It combines **rule-based detection**, **AI-powered agents**, and an **interactive dashboard** to provide transparent and explainable fraud analysis.

The system focuses on decomposing fraud detection into specialized agents rather than relying on a single monolithic model.

---

## What the Project Includes

- **Synthetic Data Pipeline** for generating realistic insurance claims with injected fraud patterns
- **Rule-Based Detection Engine** identifying suspicious claim behavior
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**, including:
  - Detection Agent (rule-based analysis)
  - Investigation Agent (AI-driven reasoning)
  - Explanation Agent (human-readable fraud justification)
  - Query Agent (natural language search over historical cases)
- **Interactive Dashboard** for fraud analytics, claim exploration, and AI-assisted investigation
- **End-to-End Pipeline** from data generation to fraud verdict

---

## Key Features

- Hybrid fraud detection using rules and AI agents
- Explainable decisions with traceable reasoning
- Modular agent design for independent evolution
- Natural language querying of claims data
- Interactive visual analytics dashboard

---

## Architecture

The system follows a coordinated multi-agent design:

1. **Synthetic Data Generator** produces labeled claim datasets  
2. **ETL Pipeline** processes and stores data  
3. **Agent Orchestrator** coordinates agent execution  
4. **Specialized Agents** analyze, investigate, and explain fraud  
5. **Dashboard UI** presents analytics and agent outputs  

This architecture emphasizes **modularity**, **fault isolation**, and **decision transparency**.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python** — core implementation
- **Streamlit** — interactive dashboard UI
- **SQLite** — data storage
- **FAISS** — vector similarity search
- **LLMs** — reasoning and explanation agents
- **Docker** — containerized execution

---

## Current Status

- Functional prototype with multiple cooperating agents
- Working dashboard for analytics and investigation
- Synthetic test data and simulated fraud scenarios
- Modular architecture ready for extension

---

## Outcome & Learnings

- Designed a real multi-agent AI system end-to-end
- Combined deterministic rules with AI reasoning
- Built explainable fraud detection pipelines
- Gained practical experience in AI orchestration and system design
