## Overview

Video Summary Generator is an AI-powered application designed to automatically extract meaningful summaries from video content by combining **visual and audio understanding**.  
Instead of relying on a single modality, the system processes video data through **two parallel pipelines**—one focused on frame-level visual analysis and the other on audio transcription and semantic interpretation—to produce more accurate and context-aware summaries.

The project explores multimodal AI workflows and efficient pipeline orchestration for real-world media processing tasks.

## Key Features

- **Parallel Processing Pipelines** for visual frame extraction and audio analysis
- **Multimodal Understanding** combining visual context and spoken content
- **Automated Video-to-Text Summarization** using LLM-based reasoning
- **Modular Pipeline Design** enabling independent optimization of each stage
- **Scalable Architecture** suitable for batch or on-demand processing

## Technologies Used

- **Python** – Core application logic
- **FFmpeg** – Video processing and frame extraction
- **Speech-to-Text Models** – Audio transcription
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** – Contextual summarization
- **Multimodal AI Pipelines** – Visual and audio data fusion
- **REST APIs** – Pipeline coordination and data exchange
- **Docker** – Containerized execution environment
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and project management

## Architecture

The system is built around **two parallel pipelines**:

- The **Visual Pipeline** extracts key frames from the video and analyzes visual cues to identify important scenes or transitions.
- The **Audio Pipeline** transcribes spoken content and performs semantic analysis on the resulting text.
- Outputs from both pipelines are merged and passed to a summarization layer that generates a coherent final summary.

This architecture improves robustness by reducing reliance on a single data source and allows each pipeline to scale independently.

## Current Status

The project is currently in a **working prototype stage**, supporting:

- End-to-end video ingestion and processing
- Parallel execution of visual and audio pipelines
- Generation of concise, human-readable summaries

Further improvements are planned to enhance accuracy and performance.

## Challenges and Learnings

- Coordinating **parallel processing pipelines** efficiently
- Handling synchronization between visual and audio outputs
- Managing compute and latency trade-offs in media processing
- Structuring multimodal inputs for effective LLM summarization
- Gaining practical experience with **real-world AI pipeline orchestration**

This project strengthened my understanding of applied multimodal AI systems.

## Outcome

Video Summary Generator demonstrates a practical application of **multimodal AI and pipeline parallelism** in media analysis.  
Future plans include smarter frame selection, improved summarization quality, and real-time processing support.

Overall, the project showcases my ability to design and implement **end-to-end AI systems** that combine multiple data sources to solve complex problems.
