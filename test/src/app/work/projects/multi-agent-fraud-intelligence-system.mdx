## Overview

The Multi-Agent Fraud Detection System is an AI-driven platform designed to identify fraudulent transactions by leveraging **multiple autonomous agents**, each responsible for analyzing fraud from a different perspective.  
Instead of relying on a single monolithic model, the system decomposes fraud detection into parallel, cooperative reasoning tasks to improve accuracy, explainability, and scalability.

The project explores how **agent-based architectures** can outperform traditional single-model approaches in complex, high-risk domains like financial fraud.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture** with specialized agents for behavioral, transactional, and anomaly analysis
- **Parallel Reasoning Pipelines** to reduce detection latency and increase coverage
- **Agent Coordination Layer** for decision aggregation and conflict resolution
- **Modular Design** allowing agents to be added, removed, or upgraded independently
- **Explainable Outputs** via agent-level reasoning and verdict traces

## Technologies Used

- **Python** – Core implementation and agent logic
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** – Intelligent reasoning and contextual analysis
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration Frameworks** – Agent coordination and task routing
- **REST APIs** – Inter-agent and service communication
- **JSON-based Event Pipelines** – Transaction and signal exchange
- **Docker** – Containerized execution environment
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and collaboration

## Architecture

The system follows a **coordinated multi-agent design**:

- Each **agent** operates independently, focusing on a specific fraud dimension such as spending patterns, historical behavior, or anomaly detection.
- An **orchestrator layer** assigns tasks, collects agent responses, and synthesizes a final fraud verdict.
- Agents run in parallel, enabling faster decisions while reducing single-point reasoning failures.
- The architecture supports future enhancements like reinforcement learning agents or real-time streaming inputs.

This design emphasizes **fault isolation**, **scalability**, and **decision transparency**.

## Current Status

The project is currently in a **functional prototype stage** with:

- Multiple working fraud analysis agents
- End-to-end fraud evaluation pipeline
- Agent coordination and response aggregation logic
- Initial test scenarios and simulated transaction data

Future iterations aim to improve real-world adaptability and performance.

## Challenges and Learnings

- Designing **agent cooperation strategies** without tightly coupling logic
- Managing inconsistent or conflicting agent outputs
- Balancing LLM reasoning depth with performance constraints
- Structuring agent prompts and roles for deterministic behavior
- Gaining practical insight into **distributed AI system design**

This project strengthened my understanding of **AI orchestration, system decomposition, and decision pipelines**.

## Outcome

The Multi-Agent Fraud Detection System demonstrates how complex decision-making problems can be solved using **collaborative AI agents** rather than single models.  
Planned enhancements include real-time data ingestion, model specialization, confidence scoring, and production-grade monitoring.

Overall, the project showcases my ability to design and implement **advanced AI systems with strong architectural foundations**, suitable for high-stakes domains.
