## Overview

Home Server is a hands-on infrastructure project focused on building and maintaining a **self-hosted server environment** for running personal and experimental services.  
The project serves as a practical playground for learning **Linux system administration, container orchestration, networking, and service reliability** outside of managed cloud platforms.

Rather than relying on third-party hosting, this setup emphasizes full ownership of the stack—from hardware and OS configuration to service deployment and monitoring.

## Key Features

- **Self-hosted Infrastructure** running on local hardware
- **Dockerized Services** for isolation, reproducibility, and easy upgrades
- **Reverse Proxy & Networking Setup** for clean service exposure
- **Service Monitoring & Health Checks** for reliability
- **Expandable Architecture** to onboard new services with minimal friction

## Technologies Used

- **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian-based)** – Server operating system
- **Docker & Docker Compose** – Containerization and service orchestration
- **Nginx / Reverse Proxy** – Traffic routing and service exposure
- **Portainer** – Container management and observability
- **Shell Scripting** – Automation and system maintenance
- **Git & GitHub** – Configuration tracking and documentation
- **Networking Concepts** – Ports, DNS, LAN access, and firewall rules

## Architecture

The system follows a **single-node modular architecture**:

- Core services are deployed as **Docker containers**, each isolated but networked via Docker bridges.
- A **reverse proxy layer** routes incoming traffic to internal services based on ports or host rules.
- Persistent volumes are used to ensure data durability across container restarts.
- The design supports future migration to multi-node or cloud-based environments with minimal changes.

This architecture mirrors production patterns commonly used in startups and internal tooling.

## Current Status

The Home Server is in an **actively used and evolving state**, currently hosting:

- Management and monitoring tools
- Development and testing services
- Internal dashboards and utilities

The setup is stable and continuously improved as new services and requirements emerge.

## Challenges and Learnings

- Debugging **networking and port conflicts** across multiple services
- Understanding Docker networking and volume persistence
- Managing service restarts and failure recovery
- Balancing security with ease of access in a home environment
- Gaining real-world experience with **infra troubleshooting**

This project significantly improved my confidence in operating and maintaining production-like systems.

## Outcome

Home Server demonstrates my ability to **own infrastructure end-to-end**, from deployment to maintenance.  
Future plans include tighter security controls, automated backups, and potentially scaling to a multi-node or hybrid setup.

The project highlights practical DevOps skills and a strong understanding of how real systems behave outside of theoretical environments.
